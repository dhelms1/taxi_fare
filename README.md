# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

Repository for Kaggle project: finding NYC taxi fare prices based on ride data. 

Note that only a subset of the data is here (around 1 million observations) and not the full 55 million observation csv provided. This is due to the testing csv file provided being around 5GB and the cleaned data being around 200MB. Refer to [Kaggle Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) to download full dataset.
